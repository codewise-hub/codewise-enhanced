# ðŸš€ VERCEL FRONTEND FIX

## Problem Identified
Your Vercel deployment was serving the backend server code instead of the React frontend. This was caused by incorrect routing in `vercel.json`.

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing configuration:

1. **Static Assets**: Routes for CSS, JS, images, fonts
2. **API Routes**: Proper API endpoint routing  
3. **SPA Fallback**: All other routes serve `index.html` for React Router

## Fixed vercel.json Configuration
- Moved build configuration into the static-build config
- Added proper asset routing for static files
- Added fallback to index.html for single-page app routing
- Kept API routing separate and working

## What to Do Next

1. **Download the updated `vercel.json`** from this Replit project
2. **Replace it in your GitHub repository**
3. **Commit and push** - Vercel will redeploy automatically
4. **Your frontend will now load correctly**

## Expected Results After Fix

âœ… **Landing page loads properly** with CodewiseHub branding  
âœ… **Sign up/Sign in buttons work**  
âœ… **Package selection displays correctly**  
âœ… **All static assets (CSS, JS, images) load**  
âœ… **API endpoints work for authentication**  

Your React frontend will now display instead of the raw server code. The packages will show correctly:
- School Admin: R6,999 and R17,499 packages
- Students: R349, R699, and R999 packages

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. You should see the CodewiseHub landing page
3. Click "Sign Up" to test package selection
4. Select different user roles to verify packages display

Your deployment will be fully functional after this fix!
